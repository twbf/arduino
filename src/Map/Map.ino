//Questions:
//what is the keyword for flash memory?
// A: PROGMEM - https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/variables/utilities/progmem/
// ----- this is not going to be simple, but short of separately running a raspberry pi and offloading
//       all large scale mapping to it (which would allow collabratively behaviour between multiple
//       bots), i don't think there is much in the way of alternatives
// ----- possible alternative: a dedicated higher end arduino (with 8KB of SRAM) only doing the mapping
//       functions and communicating over the single wire bus
//
//how to once you have avoided an obstacle come back to the original path? (needed in mapping)
// A: Maybe store the net time left and right but one would also have to use
//    the distance traveled to get back
//    so, I think that we have to use vectors and think about distance rather than time
// ----- yes, I think that is essentially correct, store a "current intended direction is blah blah", and
//       perhaps a "current adjusted direction to avoid obstacle at so and so is goo goo"
// ===== Thomas believes this is mostly comnpleted, other than:
//              --correcting left and right(don't know which is which)
//              --correcting coeficiants that convert time to distance (might be testing or using distance sensor)
//              --using corners to correct angle and location
//
//What is the syntax for a byte array?
// A: byte mapArray[32][32]; - https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=220385.0
// ----- there does seem to be some complexities about this sometimes and there is no range checking,
//       perhaps we should look for helpful libraries?
//

//we will need
